# Environmental-Assessment
This repository includes R code that extracts census data from county codes to determine which communities are near steam powerplants that exceed EPA's maximum pollutant benchmarks.
R scripts use functions in the NHDPlusERG package to create tables that "bin" demographics for two columns: exceeds and does not exceed. 
Each pollutant has multiple benchmarks options. EPA has ERG conduct this research so that EPA can choose benchmarks that avoid disproportionately affecting certain communities.
